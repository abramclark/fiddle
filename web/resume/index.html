  Developing reliable API services with Python, MySQL, Rust, Ruby, Kafka, and many other tools.
  <ul>
    <li>Led the design and implementation of an in-house address verification system that
      replaced a slow, unreliable, and expensive external API call. The final service was
      implemented in Rust, runs 50x faster and has had no service level outages, and
      resulted in large annual savings.
    <li>Designed and implemented multiple extractions from an overloaded monolith and DB.
      They were completed on time with no break in service or changes in API behavior.
      This included rigorous testing and careful migrations.
    <li>Participated in design and implementation of the back end for new API products:
      carbon offsets, insurance purchases, and analytics tools for customers. The last
      also powers a web based analytics tool, and continues to perform well for real-time
      queries as we grow.
    <li>Teach architecture, schema design, and language concepts to junior developers
  </ul>

  Conceived of and created a social media creativity platform.
  <ul>
    <li>My responsibilities: UX design, architecture, the majority of programming, hiring
      technical team, management, and some business development.
    <li>Developed full stack using Python, MongoDB, JavaScript, AWS, Git, and Google
      Analytics. The core of this was a sophisticated web based drag and drop design
      tool, coupled with a social frame that handled tagging, feeds, and comments.
    <li>Managed and grew the platform to thousands of international users (analytics shows
      115 countries).

<strong class='h2'>About Me</strong>
<p>My answer to "what're you going to be when you grow up" started out as "inventor", then
later at age 6 became "scientist". In middle school I explored books and many articles
on philosophy, microbiology, and subatomic physics. In my early teens, realizing real
scientific research is extremely slow and tedious, I developed a strong interest in
consciousness and artificial intelligence, complimented by an enthusiastic pursuit of
programming which I started in 5th grade.</p>

<p>In my early 20s it became clear to me that strong AI, if achieved at all, would likely
result in a totally opaque process that, at best, would be a poor and morally questionable
mimic of a human mind. I decided to create a far more useful technology; intuitive
software and development tools. As software subsumes more and more of our culture and
society, people increasingly rely on software engineers and designers. Along with all
engineers, I'm faced with the challenges of working with the increasingly complex tools we
are becoming increasingly dependent on.</p>

<p>More importantly, humanity's survival is becoming dependent on us making the right
decisions based on a complex systems level understanding of our natural environment and
economies. In short, I'm most excited about tools for spreading accurate information,
understanding complex systems, and teaching. Building these tools is the most positively
impactful thing I can imagine.</p>
