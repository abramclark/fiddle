    Conceived of and created a social media creativity platform. I was
    responsible for UX design, architecture, the great majority of
    programming, hiring technical team, management, and some business
    development.  Developed full stack using Python, MongoDB,
    JavaScript, AWS, Git, and Google Analytics. The core of this was a
    sophisticated web based drag and drop design tool, coupled with a
    social frame that handled tagging, feeds, and comments. It was
    adopted by thousands of users and by people all over the world
    (anylytics shows 115 countries), but we were unable to gain
    business traction.

<strong class='h2'>About Me</strong>
<p>My answer to "what're you going to be when you grow up" started out
as "inventor", then later at age 6 became "scientist". In middle
school I explored books and many articles on philosophy, microbiology,
and subatomic physics. In my early teens, realizing real scientific
research is extremely slow and tedious, I developed a strong interest
in consciousness and artificial intelligence, complimented by an
enthusiastic pursuit of programming which I started in 5th grade.</p>

<p>In my early 20s it became clear to me that strong AI, if achieved
at all, would likely result in a totally opaque process that, at best,
would be a poor and morally questionable mimic of a human mind. I
decided to create a far more useful technology; intuitive software and
development tools. As software subsumes more and more of our culture
and society, people increasingly rely on software engineers and
designers. Along with all engineers, I'm faced with the difficulties
of working with the increasingly complex tools we are becoming
increasingly dependent on.</p> 

<p>More importantly, humanity's survival is becoming dependent on the
majority of us making decisions based on a complex systems level
understanding of our natural environment and economies.</p>

<p>In short, I'm most excited about tools for understanding complex
systems and education, and building these is the most important thing
I could possibly do.</p>

<strong class='h2'>Education</strong>
<p>The foundation of my math, science, and technology came from my
Dad.  We had many "science projects" which eventually led to building
countless circuits. Some noteable examples I remember were a tesla
coil, an amplified oscilator switched by a photo diode with a tuneable
threshold (which I designed), and finally for a 5th grade science
project: a 4 bit binary adder composed only from ~50 bare CMOS logic
gates, along with an explanation of this being a small but critical
component of an arethmitic logic unit in a CPU.</p> 

<p>As a self-taught programmer, I learned through immersion on a home
PC starting at age 9 with QBASIC. Currently I'm a bit baffled about
how this happened, as my family had no Internet and no conception of
programming. I think my brother and I simply learned from the manual
and various DOS programs that came with our 486 PC. Eventually
realizing it wasn't possible to create smooth game graphics with
QBASIC, I moved on to C, learning from the Borland C manual. After
being introduced to the web at age 12, I immediately moved to Perl and
then JavaScript.</p>

<p>In high school I took every available tech class, but
there was no programming curriculum. I created 2 years of material
for two independent studies, one with my physics and chemistry
teacher, the other with my computer electronics teacher.</p>

<p>From there I started my working education at University of
Washington, learnig from faculty and the IT department. For every
career move I've found a role that stretches my skills and knowledge.
I also actively research developments in the industry and in
programming research.</p><br><br>
